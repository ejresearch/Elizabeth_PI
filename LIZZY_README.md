#  LIZZY FRAMEWORK
## AI-Assisted Long-Form Writing System

A modular command-line framework for AI-assisted creative writing, featuring structured memory, dynamic document retrieval, and iterative refinement.

##  Quick Start

1. **Set your OpenAI API key:**
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here

   ```

3. **Create a new project:**
   ```bash
   python start.py
   ```

4. **Follow the workflow:**
   ```bash
   python intake.py project_name    # Define characters & scenes
   python brainstorm.py project_name # Generate creative ideas  
   python write.py project_name     # Create polished drafts
   ```

##  Project Structure

```
projects/
â”œâ”€â”€ project_name/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ project_name.sqlite          # Isolated project database
â”‚
lightrag_working_dir/
â”œâ”€â”€ books/                           # Screenwriting guides, craft books
â”œâ”€â”€ plays/                           # Theatrical works, dialogue examples
â””â”€â”€ scripts/                         # Professional screenplays, samples
```

## ðŸ’¾ Database Schema

Each project has dedicated tables:
- **characters:** Character profiles with traits and challenges
- **story_outline:** Act/scene structure with key events  
- **brainstorming_log:** AI-generated creative ideas with context
- **finalized_draft_v1:** Polished scene drafts
- **project_metadata:** Project settings and versioning

##  Tone Presets

1. **Cheesy Romcom** - Light-hearted with obvious romantic tropes
2. **Romantic Dramedy** - Balance of romance and realistic drama
3. **Shakespearean Comedy** - Witty wordplay and elaborate schemes
4. **Modern Indie** - Quirky, authentic, unconventional storytelling
5. **Classic Hollywood** - Sophisticated dialogue, timeless romance

##  Advanced Features

### LightRAG Integration
- **Graph-based retrieval:** Semantic content discovery
- **Contextual querying:** Finds relevant material based on scene context
- **Multi-bucket support:** Different content types for varied inspiration

### Iterative Refinement
- **Versioned drafts:** Track changes and improvements
- **Context preservation:** Maintains character and story continuity
- **Feedback loops:** Each module builds on previous outputs

### Modular Architecture
- **Independent modules:** Run any stage separately
- **Data encapsulation:** Isolated project databases
- **Workflow flexibility:** Adapt to different creative processes

##  Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Initialize project
python start.py
# > Enter: "romantic_comedy_pilot"

# 2. Define story elements  
python intake.py romantic_comedy_pilot
# > Add characters: Emma (workaholic), Jake (free spirit)
# > Add scenes: Act 1 Scene 1 - Coffee shop meet-cute

# 3. Generate creative ideas
python brainstorm.py romantic_comedy_pilot  
# > Select: Romantic Dramedy tone
# > Query: scripts bucket for inspiration
# > Result: Detailed brainstorming output with dialogue ideas

# 4. Write the scene
python write.py romantic_comedy_pilot
# > Generate: Act 1, Scene 1
# > Result: Properly formatted screenplay scene
# > Export: romantic_comedy_pilot_script_20250729.txt
```
