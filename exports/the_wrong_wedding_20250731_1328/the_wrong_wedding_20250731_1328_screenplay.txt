SAMPLE SCENE
==================================================


INT. COFFEE SHOP - MORNING

MAYA CHEN enters the bustling coffee shop, looking around nervously. 
The morning rush is in full swing.

MAYA CHEN spots an empty table near the window and makes a beeline 
for it, not noticing JAKE MORRISON approaching from the opposite direction.

COLLISION.

Coffee flies everywhere. Papers scatter.

                    MAYA CHEN
          Oh no! I'm so sorry!

                    JAKE MORRISON
          No, that was totally my fault.
          I wasn't looking where I was going.

They both kneel to pick up the scattered papers, their hands touching 
briefly as they reach for the same document.

                    MAYA CHEN
          I have this amazing talent for turning
          simple tasks into disasters.

                    JAKE MORRISON
          Well, if it helps, you just made my
          morning a lot more interesting.

They lock eyes. A moment of connection.

FADE OUT.
