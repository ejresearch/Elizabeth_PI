The visualization shows:
‚Ä¢ Nodes = Entities (characters, concepts, locations)
‚Ä¢ Node size = Number of connections (bigger = more connected)
‚Ä¢ Node colors = Different connected components
‚Ä¢ Edges = Relationships between entities
‚Ä¢ Labels = Names of highly connected entities

key concepts that can inspire your writing!
