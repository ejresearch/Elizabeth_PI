FIND THE MOST IMPORTANT FIGURES: Who were the key innovators and decision-makers?\n2. IDENTIFY BREAKTHROUGH MOMENTS: What innovations changed everything?\n3. EXPLAIN EVOLUTION: How did technical capabilities advance?\n4. ANALYZE TRANSFORMATION: How did systems and models evolve?\n5. SHOW IMPACT: How did developments change society?\n\nWRITING FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS:\n• Use clear, engaging prose that maintains academic rigor\n• Include specific dates, names, and technical details as learning anchors\n• Explain complex concepts through familiar comparisons when helpful\n• Ask implicit questions students might have and answer them\n• Build knowledge progressively - each section prepares for the next\n\nAVOID TEXTBOOK PITFALLS:\n• Don't just list facts - explain their significance\n• Don't assume prior knowledge - build understanding step by step\n• Don't oversimplify - maintain intellectual rigor appropriate for college level\n• Don't lose the human stories in technical or business details"
