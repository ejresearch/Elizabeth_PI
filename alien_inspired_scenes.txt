ALIEN INSPIRED SCENES
[Original content exploring themes of cosmic horror and survival]

FADE IN:

EXT. SPACE - THE MINING VESSEL "PROMETHEUS"

A massive industrial spacecraft drifts through the void, its hull scarred by asteroid impacts and the harsh environment of deep space.

INT. PROMETHEUS - CREW QUARTERS - DAY

The ship hums with mechanical life. Seven crew members go about their routines, unaware they're being watched by something in the ship's ventilation system.

ELLEN VASQUEZ (30s), warrant officer, reviews cargo manifests in her quarters when the ship's AI, MAYA, interrupts.

MAYA (V.O.)
Officer Vasquez, we're receiving a transmission of unknown origin.

VASQUEZ
From where?

MAYA (V.O.)
The signal originates from LV-426, an uninhabited planetoid in the Zeta Reticuli system.

INT. PROMETHEUS - BRIDGE - DAY

The crew gathers around the communication station. Static fills the air, then a rhythmic pattern emerges - clearly artificial.

CAPTAIN TORRES (50s), seasoned space veteran, studies the readouts.

TORRES
How long has this been transmitting?

MAYA
Based on signal decay, approximately 2,000 years.

DR. KANE (40s), the ship's science officer, leans forward with excitement.

KANE
This could be first contact. An alien civilization trying to communicate.

CHIEF ENGINEER PARK (35s) shakes his head.

PARK
Or a warning. In my experience, signals from dead worlds are usually distress calls.

VASQUEZ
What's company policy on investigation?

TORRES
Any signal of intelligent origin must be investigated. Company orders.

The crew exchanges uneasy glances. They're miners, not explorers.

EXT. LV-426 - DAY

The planetoid's surface is a nightmare of jagged rocks and perpetual storms. The Prometheus descends through toxic atmosphere, landing near the signal's source.

EXT. LV-426 - SIGNAL SOURCE - DAY

The crew, in environmental suits, approaches a massive structure - clearly artificial but unlike any human architecture. It's biomechanical, organic curves merged with metallic surfaces.

KANE
(into comm)
The structure appears to be grown rather than built. Bio-mechanical in nature.

VASQUEZ
Stay alert. We don't know what we're walking into.

INT. ALIEN DERELICT - CORRIDOR - DAY

The interior is a cathedral of shadows and strange geometry. Walls pulse with bioluminescent veins. The air is thick with mist and alien spores.

Kane's readings spike.

KANE
The atmosphere is breathable, but I'm detecting complex organic compounds. Unknown proteins.

PARK
I don't like this. The whole place feels... alive.

They follow the signal deeper into the structure.

INT. ALIEN DERELICT - EGG CHAMBER - DAY

The team enters a vast chamber filled with thousands of large, ovoid objects arranged in perfect rows. Each "egg" stands about three feet tall, leathery surface pulsing with internal life.

VASQUEZ
What are they?

KANE
Life pods of some kind. The bio-readings are off the charts.

Kane approaches one of the eggs with his scanner. As he gets closer, the top begins to open like a flower, revealing a moist interior.

KANE (CONT'D)
Fascinating. It's responding to my presence.

VASQUEZ
Kane, get back!

But Kane leans closer. Something moves in the depths of the egg - fast, pale, spider-like.

KANE
There's something inside—

The FACEHUGGER explodes from the egg, attaching itself to Kane's helmet. The acidic creature burns through his faceplate.

VASQUEZ
(screaming into comm)
Emergency extraction! Kane is down!

INT. PROMETHEUS - MEDICAL BAY - DAY

Kane lies unconscious on the medical table, the facehugger wrapped around his head like a parasitic crown. Dr. SHAW (30s), the ship's medic, examines the creature.

SHAW
I can't remove it. Every time I try to cut it away, it tightens its grip. It's keeping him alive, providing oxygen directly to his lungs.

VASQUEZ
For how long?

SHAW
Unknown. But its bio-readings suggest it's... changing him somehow.

Through the observation window, the creature's tail twitches ominously.

INT. PROMETHEUS - MESS HALL - DAY (LATER)

Kane sits with the crew, apparently recovered. The facehugger is gone, leaving only small wounds on his face.

KANE
I feel fine. Better than fine, actually. Hungry.

He begins eating ravenously, shoveling food into his mouth faster than seems humanly possible.

TORRES
Maybe we should run some more tests—

Kane suddenly convulses, doubling over in pain.

KANE
Something's wrong. My chest... it feels like something's moving inside.

The crew backs away as Kane's convulsions worsen. His shirt begins to move, something pushing against it from within.

VASQUEZ
Shaw! Get the medical kit!

Kane screams as his chest explodes outward in a spray of blood. A small, serpentine creature bursts free, looks around at the terrified crew, then scurries away into the ship's ventilation system.

Kane collapses, dead.

INT. PROMETHEUS - VENTILATION SYSTEM - DAY

The creature, now grown to the size of a large snake, moves through the ship's ductwork with alien intelligence. It's learning the ship's layout, planning.

INT. PROMETHEUS - BRIDGE - NIGHT

The remaining crew huddles together, weapons ready.

TORRES
All right, people. We have a hostile organism loose on the ship. Standard quarantine protocols are in effect.

PARK
Standard protocols? Captain, this thing came out of Kane's chest! There's nothing standard about this situation.

VASQUEZ
Maya, seal all compartments. I want motion sensors active in every section.

MAYA
Sensors are active. However, the creature appears to be avoiding detection by moving through areas with significant electromagnetic interference.

SHAW
It's intelligent. Learning our patterns.

A sound echoes through the vents above them - scraping, like claws on metal.

TORRES
How big could it have gotten?

MAYA
Based on bio-waste analysis, the organism is growing at an exponential rate. Current estimates suggest it has tripled in size since birth.

The lights flicker. Emergency lighting kicks in, bathing everything in red.

PARK
It's in the power conduits.

INT. PROMETHEUS - ENGINE ROOM - NIGHT

Park moves cautiously through the maze of machinery, plasma rifle in hand. Steam hisses from damaged pipes. Shadows move in his peripheral vision.

PARK
(into comm)
I've got movement in Engineering. Looks like it's been feeding on the ship's bio-neural gel.

Something drops from the ceiling behind him - the XENOMORPH, now fully grown, seven feet of perfect biomechanical predator.

Park spins around, fires. The plasma bolt strikes the creature, but it barely flinches. Acid blood drips from the wound, eating through the deck plating.

PARK (CONT'D)
(screaming into comm)
Its blood is acid! The hull integrity is—

The xenomorph's inner jaw shoots out, punching through Park's helmet and skull.

INT. PROMETHEUS - BRIDGE - NIGHT

The crew listens to Park's death screams over the comm.

TORRES
That's it. We're abandoning ship.

VASQUEZ
We can't. The creature will follow us. We have to kill it here.

SHAW
How do you kill something that bleeds acid and uses our own ship against us?

VASQUEZ
Fire. Lots of fire.

The ship shudders. Hull breach alarms begin blaring.

MAYA
Warning: Multiple hull breaches detected. Atmosphere loss in sections 7 through 12.

TORRES
It's trying to kill the ship.

The lights go out completely. In the darkness, they hear the creature moving through the walls around them.

VASQUEZ
(whispered)
It's hunting us.

A shadow moves past the doorway. The xenomorph is learning their fear.

FADE OUT.
