INT. COFFEE SHOP - MORNING

{char1_name.upper()} enters the bustling coffee shop, looking around nervously. 
The morning rush is in full swing.

{char1_name.upper()} spots an empty table near the window and makes a beeline 
for it, not noticing {char2_name.upper()} approaching from the opposite direction.

COLLISION.

Coffee flies everywhere. Papers scatter.

                    {char1_name.upper()}
          Oh no! I'm so sorry!

                    {char2_name.upper()}
          No, that was totally my fault.
          I wasn't looking where I was going.

They both kneel to pick up the scattered papers, their hands touching 
briefly as they reach for the same document.

                    {char1_name.upper()}
          I have this amazing talent for turning
          simple tasks into disasters.

          Well, if it helps, you just made my
          morning a lot more interesting.

They lock eyes. A moment of connection.

FADE OUT.
